# Changelog — testbench

`./a2test`: headless end-to-end runs of the game at any resolution, with plain-text
scenarios, screenshots and reports. It installs nothing into the game: every case runs
on a reflink clone. Versioning rules: [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md), "Changelogs and
versions". Newest first. The why is in [`README.md`](README.md).

## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-25

### Added
- `a2test run | check | list | session | drive`: clone, per-resolution prepare,
  headless sway + Xwayland, umu launch, `a2input` virtual pointer/keyboard, `grim`
  capture, teardown; `index.html` / `report.md` / `results.json` per run.
- The scenario grammar (`scenarios/README.md`): deterministic steps, measured checks
  (OCR, stretch against the 4:3 reference, black bars, flat areas, logs, crash),
  judged steps and agent steps through `claude -p`.
- Scenarios: `main-menu`, `campaign-screen`, `borg-mission-1` (and its prose twin),
  `admirals-log` (menus 2.0.1), `escape-menu` (menus 2.0.2, 2.1.0), `hud` (HUD and
  font, at the Borg briefing), `stock-control`; the `_enter-borg-mission` fragment
  and `Include`.
- `ui.json`: screen signatures and click targets in 800x600 design space.

Installs nothing into the game. Validated by a bench run at 4:3, 16:10, 16:9 and 21:9;
not yet signed off.
